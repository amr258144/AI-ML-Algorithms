# AI-ML-Algorithms
This repo contains beginning practice for Artificial Intelligence algorithms.

Hi all...
I have started a project where I am planning to create few good libraries for AI/ML related algorithms in PHP 7+.
Currently I am working on Unification Algorithm in Artificial Intelligence and done some work (not in a statndard way, so need to work on that first), and tested it with some test-cases where I got 50% of result absolutely correct.

JUST TRYING NEW THINGS, STEPPING OUT OF COMFORT ZONES AND SOAR, ALL RIGHT?
